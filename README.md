# march30homework

This is a first draft of my portfolio page. I learned to connect links and use advanced CSS techniques like media queries and flexbox. Learning how to struture parent and child elements is a great tool. It presented many challenges but I feel better about having the skills to build a webpage from scratch having done this. Sites like w3schools.com and css-tricks.com were a great help. I also used small pieces of code from tutors, TAs, other students, and my teacher Gary.
