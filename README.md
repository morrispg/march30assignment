# march30assignment

This is a first draft of my portfolio page. I learned to connect links and use advanced CSS techniques like flexbox. It presented many challenges but I feel better about having the skills to build a webpage from scratch having done this. Sites like w3schools.com and css-tricks.com were a great help.
